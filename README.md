    stylewriter-node is a collection of tools
    that are useful for map-based visualization.

    To install,

    with npm:

        npm install stylewriter

    with ndistro:

        developmentseed stylewriter

    from git:

        git clone git://github.com/developmentseed/stylewriter-node.git

    Currently it doesn't aim to do the full
    stack required by tilelive [1] but rather 
    provides fundamentals of data breaks, 
    colors, and more.

    You'll need to install underscore.js
    if using ndistro:
    http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
